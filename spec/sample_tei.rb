<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>The recruiting of negro soldiers at this point, and more especially the <hi rend="underline">manner</hi> of recruiting is very damaging to our union Cause, and is in violation of the President,s proclamation, the laws of congress, and the laws of the state</p>
<p>When <hi rend="underline">armed negroes</hi> are permited to go with impunity into the Dwellings of true and Loyal men use insolent language to the family and take by force the only Servent of the family in oposition to the expresed wish of that servent -- it is not very encouraging to union men</p>
<p>Such was the case at Dr Capes of this City Yesterday morning and there is not a more <hi rend="underline">Loyal true Patriot</hi> than D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Cope on the american continent</p>
